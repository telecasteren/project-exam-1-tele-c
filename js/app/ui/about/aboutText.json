  "aboutText": "This is the blog of Tele Caster Nilsen, created during the first year of his front-end studies at Noroff School of Technology and Media.\n\nIt is a collection of stories and experiences from his life and career, both on and off the screen.\n\nThe blog takes a comic approach to entering tech \"later\" in life, with a satirical take on the author's knowledge and enlightenment.\n\nHere you can filter through and comment on posts, and last but not least play around with the neat little color-mode toggler beside the logo. Can you spot a sci-fi movie reference? ðŸ›¸"
